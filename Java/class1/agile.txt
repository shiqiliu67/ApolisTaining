# Agile Scrum Methodology

What is Agile Methodology?
Agile methodology is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development
and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project.
Both development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the waterfall model.

# Waterfall Model
The waterfall model is a relatively linear sequential approach for certain areas
In this model, as progress flows in essentially one direction like Waterfall
there might be a chance to get issues in future

# Issues with traditional development
> Unclear Requirement
> Requirement changes
> Lack of Involvement of the customer
> Accuracy of estimation
> Last minute correction is difficult
> Much time for testing and fixing bugs

The Waterfall we complete one phase before moving on to the next phase as we really
aim to revisit a phase once its completed, which means we must be sure that 
whatever we are doing, we better do it correctly for the first time

we don't realize any value until the end of the project 

We also leave testing until the end.

No involvement of the customer; hence we don't seek approval from the owner until
the end


# Agile Vs. Waterfall Method
Agile and Waterfall models are two different methods for the software development process.
Though they are different in their approach, both ways are helpful depending upon the type of project.

- Agile process is broken into individual models that designer work on
- The customer has early and frequent opportunities to look at the product and make 
decision and changes to the project
- Small projects can be implemented very quickly for a large project. It is 
difficult to estimate the development cost
- Error can be fixed in the middle of the project
- development process is executed in short (2-4) weeks planning is less
- documentation attends less priority than software development
- Every iteration has its own testing phase
- testers and developers work together
- at the end of every sprint, user acceptance is performed


-Waterfall design process is not broken
- The customer can only see the product at the end of the project
- All sort of project can be estimated and completed
- only at the end the whole product is tested if any error found and 
require changes, the project has to start from the beginning
- the development process is phased where every phase end with detailed
description of the next phase
- documentation is a top priority, and these document can be used for training
staff
- Only after the development phase the testing executed
- tester and developer work separately
- user acceptance is performed at the end of the project

# SCRUM 
Scrum is an agile development method that concentrates specifically on how to manage
the task with the team-based development environment
Basically, Scrum is derived from an activity that occurs during a rugby match.
Scrum believes in empowering the development team and encourage working in a small team.


Roles
1. Product Owner
2. Scrum Master
3. Team


> Product Owner
Create the product backlog, prioritize the backlog, and also responsible for the delivery
of the functionality at each iteration

> Scrum Master
Is responsible for setting up the team. sprint meeting and removes obstacles to
progress

> Team
The team manages its own work and organizes the work to complete the sprint cycle.

# Scrum Call
- What we have done so far
- What we will be going to do now
- Is there any blocker
